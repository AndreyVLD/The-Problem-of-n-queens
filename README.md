# The-Problem-of-n-queens
The problem consists in placing n queens (a given number) on a chessboard of n*n squares.
The queens must not the place on the same: row, column and diagonal.
The program will find all possible placements and will display them in numbers on a row with the following meaning:
   -the number you see is the number of the column of the chessboard and its position taken from left to right is the row of the chess board.
    (Ex 2 4 1 3, means the first queen will be placed on the first row, second column
                       the second queen will be placed on the second row, the forth column
                       the third queen will be placed on the third row, first column
                       the fourth queen will be placed on the fourth row, third column)
